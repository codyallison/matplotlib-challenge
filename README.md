This repository holds code to perform data analysis for a fictional medical study on mice receiving different treatment drugs and how it effects the tumor volume of each mouse. The raw data can be found in the "data" folder. The code itself is found in the 'pymaceuticals.ipynb file'. 

To run the analysis open the jupyter notebook file and you can run each cell by pressing the Play button at the top of the UI. Additionally, you can save the file as a python file (.py) and run the code in a text editor of your choice.
